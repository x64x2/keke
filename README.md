This is my spin on [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), the unexpected smash hit puzzle game in which you try to guess a certain 5 letter word in 6 guesses or less. Every time you guess, it gives you feedback on whether each letter in your guess: but it's in igbo

- Was in the answer at correct spot (Indicated with a green box)

- Was in answer but not at correct spot (Indicated with a yellow box)

- Was not in answer at all (Indicated by grey box)

It's not as pretty, and it's ephemeral, unlike the original, but through more development I hope to learn more about web development and associated best practices.

The allowed word list was taken from [this very helpful repo](https://github.com/tabatkins/wordle-list). As for the answers, for now I just have it pick a random word from the allowed word list oops.
